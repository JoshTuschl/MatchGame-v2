The main file is MainActivity.java. The code is not a good example of object oriented design but is functional.

Several classes reside within MainActivity. They are:

1. FlippedCard - a class that helps in tracking which cards have been selected.

2.CustomTimerTask and CustomHandler - two classes that create a timer and receive a call when the timer has expired, allowing execution of code at that point. 

The layout is written in xml in activity_main.xml. Drawables that are used for cards are found in bin/res/drawable-mdpi.
